This PCB design was used to distribute power to each of the 9 LED Controller boards, as well as the arduino. As an input it takes a TDK-Lambda DT150PW120C 120V AC Adaptor, but can accept any 12V power source given slight modification as described in the Assembly Overview file. This device could be improved by adding heatsinks to the 5V regulators, but works as designed for all intended applications.
