This PCB design was used to attach all LEDs to their controllers, facilitating easy soldering by hand. The boards were chained together to provide serial communication across all LEDs. These boards use TLC5926 LED Controller Chips (Texas Instruments) for LED Control. See the Assembly Instructions file for an assembly overview. Our design used 9 identical boards of this design.
